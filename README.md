# EY Hackathon Project - Frontend Prototype

This repository contains the frontend prototype developed for the EY Hackathon. The prototype is designed to assist students in identifying skill gaps, providing personalized recommendations, and guiding them through tailored learning paths to improve their employability.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-navigate design.
- **Skill Assessment:** Captures user inputs for skill evaluation.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests learning resources based on user needs.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for multiple devices (desktop and mobile).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and logic.
- **React.js**: For building the dynamic user interface.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
